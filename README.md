This repo gives a head start, that how to work with AWS lambda , API Gateway and dynamodb.
Some points to take care about:-

1. Table must exist, so create table first inside dynamodb.
2. lambda.js contains code(which needs to paste inside lambda function console).
3. Some basic info to take care about is included inside info file.
4. app.js is running on localhost and serving basic UI(html).
